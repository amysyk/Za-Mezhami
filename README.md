A practical guide to product management by Andriy Mysyk

This is a list of non-obvious product management mechanics that I had to explain to my teammates. To stay focused on describing the mechanics (rather than promoting myself), I write as if I was giving advice to my children who at the time of this writing are five and seven. I hope that if they choose to practice product management in their adult lives, they will find my advice useful.
