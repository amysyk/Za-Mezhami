A practical guide to product management by Andriy Mysyk

This is a list of non-obvious product management mechanics. To stay focused on describing the mechancis (rather than promoting myself), I write as if I was giving advice to my children who at the time of this writing are five and seven. I hope that if they choose to practice product management when they grow up, they will  find my advice useful.
