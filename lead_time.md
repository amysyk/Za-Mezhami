# Time to meaningful adoption for a new feature could be measured in quarters

In business-to-business commerce where most of my experience is, it could take 6-9 months for customers to discover and ramp up the use of a newly released software.

| Phase | Elapsed time |
|-------|----------------------|
| Discovery | 1-3 months|
| Backlog | 2-4 months |
| Development | 1-3 months |
| Ramp up | 2-3 months |

Despite software companies' sincere attempt to push information about new features to customers, the right decisions makers on the customers don't discovery that a new valuable feature is available to them, often at no extra charge. If you're lucky, one of your email marketing campaigns, blogs, webinars, changelogs, or roadmap review will get through the right decision makers in 1-3 months after the release.

Medium- to large-size business typically have practices for introducing process changes. So, any software improvements that introduce processes have to be priorotized and scheduled among competiting priorties that could take another 2-4 months.

If adoptig the software features requires code changes, like it often does with mine, it could take customer developers another 1-3 months to make, test and release code changes to test your feature.

Finally, training customer teams and moving traffic to the new software could 2-3 more months.
